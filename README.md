TextSnap Python Script Overview
This script is a comprehensive Python application named 'TextSnap,' designed for text extraction, editing, and management. Here's an overview of its key components and features:

Key Features:

1. OCR (Optical Character Recognition):
The script utilizes the `pytesseract` library to perform OCR on images, extracting text from various image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF). It processes multiple images selected by the user and extracts text, which is then cleaned up for better readability.

2. User Interface:
The script features a command-line-based user interface built with the `curses` library. Users can navigate through various menus to perform tasks such as scanning images, editing extracted text, saving text to files, copying text to the clipboard, and interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

3. File Management and Security:
Extracted text can be saved to new or existing text files. The script ensures the directory where files are saved (`textsnapmapa`) is hidden and protected. Encryption is implemented using the `cryptography` library (Fernet) to securely store configuration data, including the encryption key and admin password. The script also provides functionalities for hiding, unhiding, protecting, and unprotecting files.

4. ChatGPT Integration:
Users can upload the extracted text to ChatGPT via OpenAI's API and receive a response. The API key is securely managed and can be saved directly into the script for persistent use.

5. Customization:
The script allows users to customize the color scheme of the interface to enhance the user experience. Admin features include the ability to change the admin password, remove the `textsnapmapa` directory, and view or reset scan statistics.

6. Multi-threading and UI Feedback:
A loading bar is displayed during initialization, implemented via multi-threading, to provide feedback to the user during potentially time-consuming operations. The script also features a system for displaying real-time feedback and results for user actions within the interface.

7. Error Handling and Robustness:
The script includes robust error handling to manage issues like failed image processing, API interactions, and file permissions.

Usage Flow:

1. Initialization:
The script initializes by loading or generating encryption keys and configuration settings. A loading bar is displayed to the user during this process.

2. Main Menu:
The main menu presents options for scanning images, editing text, saving text, copying to the clipboard, and interacting with ChatGPT. Users can navigate through the menu using arrow keys and select options by pressing Enter.

3. Text Handling:
After scanning, the extracted text is available for editing, saving, or further processing. Users can opt to edit the text using a built-in text editor window or save it directly to a file.

4. Options and Customization:
In the options menu, users can set or change their OpenAI API key, modify the interface color scheme.
